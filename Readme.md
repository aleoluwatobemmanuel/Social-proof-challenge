# This project was gotten from the frontend mentor challenge website. 

## It is a social-proof page, where the reviews of a particular brand were stated. It contained the ratings, and reviews from three of their clients which were Colton, irene and Anne.

### Their reviews were written in three different boxes that were the same size but of different positions. So, i had to use different CSS properties to achieve what was in the original requirement.

#### Although, i didn't exactly achieve what was in the original requirement, but i will continue to improve on it subsequently on my Github page.
